# _Trochulus_ Population genetics based on ddRAD sequencing data

In this project, we investigate  genetic diverstity and differentiation in closely related land snails of the genus _Trochulus_. Despite occuring in sym- and parapatry, these snails are divided into highly distinct mitochondrial clades. It is not yet known, if similar patterns are also found in the nuclear genome.

We therefore generated ddRAD sequencing data based on double-digestion of genomic DNA of **XX** individual samples (of **XX** species and subspecies) with enzymes **XX** and **YY**. Paired-end libraries (kit **XX**) were multiplexed and sequenced on a Illumina **XX** machine by company **XX**.

We obtained demultiplexed raw reads
